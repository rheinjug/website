<p>Der Vortrag wird auf deutsch gehalten</p> <p>Abstract:<br/>GraalVM is a new high-performance virtual machine, bringing new performance optimizations for individual languages and interoperability for creating polyglot applications. In this talk we’ll discuss the most recent project updates, and how it can help you make applications development more powerful and productive. You will learn what you can do with GraalVM, in particular: use it as a JIT compiler, compile Java programs ahead of time for faster startup and lower footprint, create fast and efficient polyglot programs, and more. You’ll also discover what the best cases for using GraalVM, where to start, and how to configure it for your project.</p> <p>Bio:<br/>Tim Felgentreff is a member of the GraalVM team at Oracle Labs where he leads the Python implementation team. He has been interested in programming language and virtual machine design and has worked on the PyPy/RPython project for other dynamic language VMs before joining Oracle. He still collaborates with the Hasso Plattner Institute at the University of Potsdam on VM and language topics.</p>
