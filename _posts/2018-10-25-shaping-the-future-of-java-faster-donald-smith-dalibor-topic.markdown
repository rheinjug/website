<p>Abstract:<br/>The Java SE Platform and the JDK have moved to a rapid, six-month release cadence, with the Java 11 release in September, 2018 and the next release in March 2019. We’ll review the motivations for this change and discuss how this impacts users.</p> <p>Speakers:<br/>Donald Smith, MBA, MSc, is Senior Director of Product Management for Oracle. He brings global enterprise software experience, ranging from startups through Fortune 500 companies. Donald has decades of experience speaking about Java, open source, community development, business models, business integration and software development politics at conferences and events worldwide. Donald's background includes helping develop the first commercially successful Object-Relational Mapping products for Smalltalk and Java, transitioning to Java EE Application Servers and driving the Eclipse Foundation through years of rapid growth where he still sits on the IP Advisory Committee. For the past six years Donald has run Java SE Product Management.</p> <p>Dalibor Topic lives in Hamburg, Germany, and works as Principal Product Manager for Oracle. He joined the OpenJDK project in order to help make it a successful open source project, and stayed for anchoring Java in Linux distributions, and as an all around Java F/OSS community guy. He joined the Java strategy team at Oracle to help provide community feedback into the long-term strategy planning.</p>
